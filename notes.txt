"I should be updating my LinkedIn, but I was too busy coding this instead."

Start with a landing page, trigger a transition when they scroll.
Random width rectangles start at bottom and go up.
Use a large blob of these to hide the landing page and show the website.

Alternatively, just scroll the landing page up like a presentation.
